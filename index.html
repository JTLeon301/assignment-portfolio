        <h2>About This Application</h2>
        <p>This application serves as a showcase for all my projects, including previous, current, and future assignments. Each project is displayed in its own block, providing a brief description and clicking it leads to the hosted website. I aim to create an easy-to-navigate interface that highlights my work and skills related to this class.</p>

            <h2>Getting to Know Each Other</h2>
            <p>This is a simple website hosted using GitHub pages to teach my classmates about myself. It was based off of a template given by our teacher and I had to answer each question while also enhancing it.</p>

            <h2>Web Dice Roller</h2>
            <p>This is a website hosted using Microsoft Azure that has simple functionality. The web app is a Dice Rolling game similar to an unfinished version of Yahtzee where the user clicks a button and it rolls 5 dice and adds up the total at the end of each roll.</p>

            <h2>Web Resume</h2>
            <p>This is my current resume hosted using Microsoft Azure. It contains all relevant information about me and has a print button at the bottom that allows the person reading it to print a .pdf version of it.</p>
