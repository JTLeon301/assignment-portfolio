        <h2>About This Application</h2>
        <p>This application serves as a showcase for all my projects, including previous, current, and future assignments. Each project is displayed in its own block, providing a brief description and a link to view more details. I aim to create an easy-to-navigate interface that highlights my work and skills related to this class.</p>

            <h2>Getting to Know Each Other</h2>
            <p>This is a simple website hosted using GitHub pages to teach my classmates about myself. It was based off of a template given by our teacher and I had to answer each question while also enhancing it.</p>
